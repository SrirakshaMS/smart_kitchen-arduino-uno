# Smart Kitchen Automation Using Arduino Uno

Arduino is a microcontroller platform which provides solution to automation. The system is controlled by a software program developed using the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE). 

The project aims on automating the kitchen using Arduino Uno. The main focus is on automating a range of tasks in kitchen, such as controlling light and exhaust fan when low intensity light and smoke are detected respectively. Adding on, we have incorporated a motion sensor to detect movement of insects and activate the buzzer, and a smart trash bin to open itâ€™s flap when an object at a distance is detected.
Objective: enhance the safety, efficiency and convenience of the kitchen.
#### Sensors used: LDR sensor, PIR motion sensor, MQ2 gas sensor, Ultrasonic sensor
#### Other apparatus: Arduino Uno, LEDs, buzzer, dc motor, 5V relay channel, battery, servo motor, jumper wires, breadboard
